Problem 1
(a) 1 and 4 are all acceptable.
(b) 2, 3 and 4 are all acceptable.
(c)  2, 3, 4 and 5 are all recommended.
(d) 2 is the policy.
(e) 2, 3, 4 and 5 will all ensure correct submission.

Problem 2
(a) 3 is accepted and supported.
(b) 1, 2 and 3 should be avoided.
(c) 1. git add hw1q2b.cpp       
    2. git log -p -3
(d) git will commit all the files that are staged for commit.
(e) git clone git@github.com:gauravma/csci104.git

Problem 4:
a) Follow code:
funcA(a, 5)
funcB(a, 0, 4);
funcB(a, 0, 2);
funcB(a, 0, 1);
funcB(a, 0, 0);
cout << 1;
funcB(a, 1, 1);
cout << 2;
funcB(a, 2, 2);
cout << 3;
funcB(a, 3, 4);
funcB(a, 3, 3);
cout << 4;
funcB(a, 4, 4);
cout << 5;

Why this happens: lines 21 through 24 and line 31 are all results of the function call 
line funcB(a, min, mid), while lines 26, 28, 30, and 33 are all results of the 
function call line funcB(a, mid+1, max).

b) funcB fails to terminate when the value of min is greater
than max, resulting in infinite calls without entering the 
if statement (or the base case).In all other cases, it will eventually hit
the base case because min will = max.

c) funcB(a, min, max), outputs the array elements in index order from the min value
to the max value. This happens when min <= max as the function recurses into two 
halves each time. If min > max, the it recurses infinite times.
